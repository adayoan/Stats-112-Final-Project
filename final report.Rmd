## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
library(nlme)
library(mgcv)
library(GGally)
library(lme4)

#aids <- read_csv(here::here("data/aids.csv"))
aids <- read_csv("~/Downloads/aids.csv")

# change treatment to factor
aids %<>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment),
         gender = factor(gender))

glimpse(aids)

# number of participants
num_of_subjects <- n_distinct(aids$id)
```
There are 4 relevant covariates: treatment, age, gender, and week. The response variable is log_cd4. There are `r num_of_subjects` subjects.

```{r}
# spaghetti plot
aids %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = log_cd4, group = id, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point() + 
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Log(cd4) by Week")
```
Looking at the data by individual, there doesn't seem to be any significant outliers. The data is unbalanced, measurements were not taken at the same occasions. Therefore, Analysis of Response Profiles cannot be used.

### Univariate Summaries
```{r}
summary(aids) %>% 
  knitr::kable()

aids_wide <- spread(aids, week, log_cd4)

aids_wide %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Age (Years)") +
  ggtitle("Count of Ages") +
  theme_light()

aids %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Time Since Baseline (weeks)") +
  ggtitle("# of Participations During Each Week") +
  theme_light()

aids_wide %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Gender") +
  ggtitle("# Participants by Gender") +
  theme_light()
```
The dataset has nearly eight times more males than females, in accordance with how males make up the majority of those suffering from AIDS. In terms of age, the majority of the participants are between 30 and 40, and the data is skewed right.  
The measurement occasions span 40 weeks, with the mean being being less than 20, indicating that there are more observations in the first half of the study than the second half. The times when measurements are taken varies a lot.


## LME Model
As the timing and number of measurement occasions differ by individual, a linear mixed-effects model would be more suited to the data than a general least squares model. 

```{r}
aids %<>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4)),
         gender = factor(gender, levels = c("male", "female")))
```

Model with Interaction Terms and Random Intercepts
$E(log\_cd4_{ij})=\beta_1 + \beta_2week_{ij} + \beta_2treatment_{i}\times week_{ij}+ \beta_3gender_i\times treatment_i+ \beta_4age_i\times treatment_i + b_{1i} + b_{2i} \times week_{ij}$ 
```{r}
model_rand_interaction <- lme(log_cd4 ~ week + treatment:week + gender:treatment + age:treatment,
                              data = aids,
                              random = ~ week | id,
                              method = "ML")
summary(model_rand_interaction)
```

Model with Random Intercepts
$E(log\_cd4_{ij})=\beta_1 + \beta_2week_{ij} + b_{1i} + b_{2i} \times week_{ij}$ 
```{r}
model_rand <- lme(log_cd4 ~ week,
                  data = aids,
                  random = ~ week | id,
                  method = "ML")
summary(model_rand)
```

Testing Anova between With and Without Interaction Terms
According to the exploratory data analysis, the interaction between treatment and gender, and treatment and age are potentially interesting. Here we shall test if they, along with the interaction term between treatment and week, are needed:  
$H_0:\beta_2=\beta_3=\beta_4=0$  
$H_1:H_0$ is not true. 
```{r}
anova(model_rand, model_rand_interaction)
```
With a p-value of <.0001, there is statistical evidence needed to reject the null hypothesis that $\beta_2=\beta_3=\beta_4=0$.

## Residual Analysis


## GLME Model
```{r}
aids %<>% 
  mutate(cd4 = round(exp(log_cd4) - 1),
         week_sqr = week^2)
```

GLME Model With Interaction Terms and Random Intercepts
$E(cd4_{ij})=\beta_1 + \beta_2week_{ij} + \beta_3week_{ij}^2 + \beta_4treatment_{i}\times week_{ij}+ \beta_5gender_i\times treatment_i+ \beta_6age_i\times treatment_i + b_{1i} + b_{2i} \times week_{ij}$ 
```{r}
model_glmer <- glmer(cd4 ~ week + week_sqr + treatment:week + gender:treatment + age:treatment + (week | id),
               family = poisson,
               nAGQ = 0,
               data = aids)
summary(model_glmer)
```

LME Model With Interaction Terms and Random Intercepts
$E(log\_cd4_{ij})=\beta_1 + \beta_2week_{ij} + \beta_3week_{ij}^2 + \beta_4treatment_{i}\times week_{ij}+ \beta_5gender_i\times treatment_i+ \beta_6age_i\times treatment_i + b_{1i} + b_{2i} \times week_{ij}$ 
```{r}
model_lme <- lme(log_cd4 ~ week + week_sqr + treatment:week + gender:treatment + age:treatment,
                              data = aids,
                              random = ~ week | id,
                              method = "ML")
summary(model_lme)
```
When comparing AIC, the model produced by the `lme()` function has the lower value of 11997.97, compared to the model produced by `glmer()`, which is 52894.5. The lme model is therefore superior.
