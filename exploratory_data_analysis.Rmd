```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)

aids <- read_csv(here::here("data/aids.csv"))

# change treatment to factor
aids %<>% 
  mutate(treatment = factor(treatment),
         gender = factor(gender))

glimpse(aids)

# number of participants
num_of_subjects <- n_distinct(aids$id)
```
There are 4 relevant covariates: treatment, age, gender, and week. The response variable is log_cd4. There are `r num_of_subjects` subjects.

```{r}
# spaghetti plot
aids %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = log_cd4, group = id, color = treatment)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```
The data is unbalanced, measurements were not taken at the same occasions. Therefore, Analysis of Response Profiles cannot be used.

### Univariate Summaries
```{r}
summary(aids)
```
