As the timing and number of measurement occasions differ by individual, a linear mixed-effects model would be more suited than a general least squares model.
```{r}
aids <- read_csv(here::here("data/aids.csv"))

model_random_week <- lme(log_cd4 ~ week + treatment:week,
                         data = aids,
                         random = ~ week | id,
                         method = "REML")

summary(model_gls)
```
